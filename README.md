# Responsivekit for web2py !
## unifying my personal efforts for web2p2 responsiveness

Here you can find a comprehensive plugin for responsive design in web2py.
It's not so somplete right now, but I planned adding more features.

It's based on my previuos work (web2py-responsive-tables) which it incorporates and new features like responsive images.
